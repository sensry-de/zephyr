  max-frame-size:

    description: |
      Maximum ethernet frame size.  The current ethernet frame sizes
      supported by hardware are 1518, 1536 and 10240 (jumbo frames).  This
      means that normally gmac will reject any frame above max-frame-size
      value.  The default value is 1518, which represents an usual
      IEEE 802.3 ethernet frame:

        Ethernet Frame [ 14 MAC HEADER | 1500 MTU | 4 FCS ] = 1518 bytes

      When using value 1536 it is possible extend ethernet MAC HEADER up
      to 32 bytes.  The hardware have support to jumbo frames and it can be
      enabled by selecting the value 10240.

  max-speed:
    type: int
    default: 1000
    description: |
      This specifies maximum speed in Mbit/s supported by the device.  The
      gmac driver supports 10Mbit/s and 100Mbit/s.  Using 100, as default
      value, enables driver to configure 10 and 100Mbit/s speeds.
